Set:
Concurrency

Description:
Drivers from the Linux 4.0 kernel have pairs of entry points called concurrently
as pthread threads.  Global and heap memory accesses are checked for data races.

The environment required for these drivers is closed, and all dependencies can
be found in the model folder.  When preprocessing is done, the '-I' switch
should be used, and should point to the model folder (i.e., '-I ./model/').
